# Data wrangling in the cloud

This repo consists of the assets for a two-part blog series I have written on loading and managing data on Google Cloud. 

## extract

This directory relates to the post [Serverless data ingestion into BigQuery](http://tamaszilagyi.com/blog/2019/2019-02-10-serverless/) which describes how to use Cloud Functions and BigQuery transfer to load data. 

## dbt

The contents of `dbt/` is the subject of the post [No frills data warehousing with dbt](http://tamaszilagyi.com/blog/2019/2019-03-05-dbt/) and is an example of a dbt package that facilitates building robust and scalable datapipelines run exclusively on the database's execution engine.
