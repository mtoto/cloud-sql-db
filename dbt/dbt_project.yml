# This setting configures which "profile" dbt uses for this project. Profiles contain
# database connection information, and should be configured in the  ~/.dbt/profiles.yml file

# These configurations specify where dbt should look for different types of files.
# The `source-paths` config, for example, states that source models can be found
# in the "models/" directory. You probably won't need to change these!

# You can define configurations for models in the `source-paths` directory here.
# Using these configurations, you can enable or disable models, change how they
# are materialized, and more!

# In this example config, we tell dbt to build all models in the example/ directory
# as views (the default). Try changing `view` to `table` below, then re-running dbt
